\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

Air accident investigations usually involve reading and interpreting large volumes of flight data.
Visualising this data, especially in a geographic context makes its analysis easier. Therefore the Air
Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) needed a tool that would render a 3 dimensional model of flight data
from their datasets. The data includes measurements like latitude, longtitude, altitude, heading, roll, thrust etc over time.
To meet this criteria I designed a Clojure based application that takes a dataset in csv format and renders
aircraft attitude over time on a map. The application generates a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file which
 can be opened on Google Earth and displays the 3d model of the data.\\
