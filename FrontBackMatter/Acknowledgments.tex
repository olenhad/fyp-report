\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Colin Tan for recommending this project to me and for giving me
full independence in the implementation. I would also like to thank Mr. Steven Teo of AAIB for his prompt
and helpful feedback over the course of the project. \\

I also would like to extend my thanks to the clojure community in general for releasing such a magnitude of
powerful open source libraries that made this project incredibly fun to work on.\\

Lastly, I would like to thank Mina, my girlfriend, for being patient.
